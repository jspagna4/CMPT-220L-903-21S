This Java program is designed to create a fully-functional binary search tree. 

A binary search tree is a non-linear data structure that contains elements called "nodes". The first node in the tree (at the top) is the root node. 
The root node, like all other nodes, has a maximum of 2 "children" nodes whose values are either greater than or less than the "parent" node, or in this 
case, the root node. The tree branches downwards, with lower value nodes placed to the left and higher value nodes placed to the right. This pattern 
continues throguhout the entire tree.

This program contains a method that inserts elements into the tree a well as a method that removes elements from the tree.

Included in this program are search methods for the tree. There are methods for in order, pre order, and post order traversals (depth first searches) that 
list off each element in the tree that follows a particular order. These traversals go down the levels of the tree before going across each level, with 
slight variations. Also included is a breadth first search which traverses through each element of a level before moving down a branch.

With this program, you can instantly create a sorted, bianry search tree from scratch, while being able to modify and traverse the tree.
